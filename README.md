Description
============

This plugin provides an export of article metadata.
After installation, a new sidebar block "EXPORT METADATA" is displayed containing the following elements:
- buttons by which the scope of the export can be determined: 
  all articles of the current journal, all articles of the current issue or just the current article
- a select box for choosing one of the formats BibTeX, MARC XML, RDF and RIS
  
By clicking "Export" the automatic download of the export file starts.

In contrast to the already existing citation plugin of OJS (as part of the "reading tools"), the metadata are not only displayed, but also offered for download.

Installation
============

- rename the unzipped folder to *metadataExport* and copy it to *plugins/generic*
- execute the following shell command: 
  *$ php tools/upgrade.php upgrade* (see https://pkp.sfu.ca/ojs/UPGRADE)
- in *Setup / Step 5* move the metadata export block to the appropriate position in the sidebar
