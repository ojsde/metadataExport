# Export of bibliographic metadata
This plugin provides an export of article metadata.
After installation, a new sidebar block "EXPORT METADATA" is displayed containing the following elements:
- buttons by which the scope of the export can be determined: 
  all articles of the current journal, all articles of the current issue or just the current article
- a select box for choosing one of the formats BibTeX, MARC XML, RDF and RIS
  
By clicking "Export" the automatic download of the export file starts.
